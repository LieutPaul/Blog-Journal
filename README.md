# Blog-Journal
Webapp that allows you to add and remove blog posts. Uses database(MongoDB) to perform CRD operations on the posts and to store the posts.
Requires MongoDB to be running on the system.
Implemented it as a part of the Udemy Web Development Course but finished all parts of the code as challenges without referring to the solution.

# Extra Implementation
Added a new functionality where you can create Users by Signing Up and Logging in to your user account.
Each User can add and delete their own blog posts.
Implemented using PassportJS and Mongoose.
